Certainly! You can style your logout button using SCSS by adding some CSS rules. Here's an example:

Assuming you have a button in your component's template (e.g., app.component.html):

```html
<button class="logout-button" (click)="logout()">Logout</button>
```

Now, in your component's SCSS file (e.g., app.component.scss), you can add styling:

```scss
.logout-button {
  background-color: #dc3545;  // Red color (you can customize)
  color: #fff;               // White text (you can customize)
  border: none;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 5px;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #c82333;  // Darker red on hover (you can customize)
  }
}
```

This is a simple example, and you can customize the styles based on your application's design. Adjust the colors, padding, and other properties to fit your desired button appearance.
